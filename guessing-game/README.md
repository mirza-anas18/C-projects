# ðŸŽ¯ Guess the Number (C Program)

This is a simple **"Guess the Number"** game written in **C**. The program generates a random number between **1 and 100**, and the player must guess it with hints provided after each guess.

## ðŸ”¹ How the Game Works:
- The program selects a **random number** between **1 and 100**.
- The player enters a guess.
- The program provides hints:
  - **"Lower number please!"** if the guess is too high.
  - **"Higher number please!"** if the guess is too low.
- The game continues until the player correctly guesses the number.
- The program displays the **total number of guesses** taken.

## ðŸš€ How to Run:
1. **Clone the repository** or **download the guess_the_number.c file**.
2. **Compile the program** using a C compiler like **GCC**:
   ```bash
   gcc guess_the_number.c -o guess
